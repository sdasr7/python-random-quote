# Let's Write a Python Quote Bot!

This repository will get you started with building a quote bot in Python. It's meant to be used along with the [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com) intro to Python.
This code defines a main() function that simply assigns the quote "Keep it logically awesome." to a variable named quote, and then prints it. When you run this code, it will print the desired quote directly.

When complete, you'll be able to grab random quotes from the command line, like this:

> **$** python get-quote.py
> 
> Keep it intelectually awesome
> 
> **$** python get-quote.py
> 
> Speak like a human
